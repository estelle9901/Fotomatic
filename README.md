# FotomaticOverview
This project is a fully self-developed responsive website for a fictional camera accessories store.
Unlike step-by-step tutorials, the project provided only high-level design requirements, leaving the entire structure, styling, and responsiveness to be implemented from scratch.

The main challenge — and focus — of this project was responsive design. The layout, typography, and images adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Highlights
Built from scratch using HTML and CSS without any starter templates.

Responsive-first approach, prioritizing usability and aesthetics on all devices.

Utilized flexbox and media queries to create flexible layouts.

Customized fonts, colors, and styling to align with the brand’s identity.

Clean, semantic HTML structure and maintainable CSS.

This project demonstrates my ability to independently translate design specifications into a functional, responsive, and professional-looking website.
