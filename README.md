# Fotomatic Overview

This project involved fixing and completing a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic, a fictional camera accessories store. The goal was to update the site so that it matches the provided design specifications exactly (design spec link).

I worked entirely on my own to identify and resolve layout, styling, and responsiveness issues. Using Chrome DevTools extensively, I inspected CSS rules, debugged style conflicts, and tested changes in real time to ensure a pixel-accurate match to the design.

Key Work
Debugged and fixed broken CSS to restore layout and visual style.

Applied responsive design principles to ensure proper display on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Used flexbox, media queries, and font/color adjustments to align with the spec.

Employed Chrome DevTools for efficient debugging, rule toggling, and live style testing.

Improved site performance and maintainability with clean, semantic HTML & CSS.

This project demonstrates my ability to diagnose and repair existing codebases, implement responsive web design, and work with professional debugging tools to meet exact design requirements.
